    "If $ \\mathbb{E}[f^2]<∞$ and $\\mathbb{E}[[ || -z || ]^2]<∞$ and $\\mathbb{E}[zz^T]$ is a non singular matrix then the OLS estimator is consistent (if observations are IID).\n",

    "However, our samples $(z_t,f_t)$ are not iid so we cannot use this proposition to say that our estimator is consistent.   \n",
    "Our estimation of $a$ using an OLS in question 2 is biased so the theorical conditions that should ensure that the estimator of $ω$ using the function f_tilde has a lower variance than the estimator of $\\omega$ using the function f are not met.  \n",
    "This explains why in question 2 we had a slighlty higher variance of the estimator of $\\omega_1$ than estimator of $\\omega_1$ using the function f. \n"
